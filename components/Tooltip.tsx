  'Operating Expense Ratio': 'The % of revenue consumed by operating costs. Lower is better. Above 55% signals thin margins.',
  'Net Operating Income': 'Revenue minus all operating expenses, before any debt payments. The primary profitability metric for rental property.',
  'NOI Margin': 'Net Operating Income as a % of gross revenue. Healthy properties target 40%-65%.',
  'Vacancy Rate': '% of potential rent lost to empty units. Industry target is under 7%. High vacancy points to a leasing or retention problem.',
  'Debt Service Coverage Ratio': 'How many times NOI covers mortgage/loan payments. Lenders require at least 1.25x. Below 1.0x means the property cannot pay its own debt.',
  'Gross Potential Rent': 'Maximum rent achievable if every unit were occupied at full asking price. This is the theoretical income ceiling.',
  'Concession Rate': 'Rent discounts given to attract or retain tenants (e.g. "first month free"), as a % of gross potential rent.',
  'Bad Debt Rate': 'Rent that was never collected and written off as a loss, as a % of revenue. Above 1% warrants attention.',
  'Payroll %': 'Staff and personnel costs as a percentage of total revenue. Typically 10%-25% for multifamily.',
  'Management Fee %': 'Property management company fees as a % of revenue. Industry standard is 4%-8%.',
  'Controllable Expense %': 'The share of total expenses that management can directly reduce, like maintenance or staffing.',
  'Break-Even Occupancy': 'The minimum occupancy rate needed to cover all operating expenses. Below this point the property loses money.',
  'Cash Flow Margin': 'Cash remaining as a % of revenue after ALL costs including debt payments.',
  'Controllable Expenses': 'Costs that management can directly influence: payroll, repairs, marketing, and supplies.',
  'Non-Controllable Expenses': 'Fixed costs management cannot easily change: property taxes, insurance, and replacement reserves.',
  'Gross Revenue': 'Total income collected from rents and other sources after vacancies and deductions.',
  'Total Operating Expenses': 'All costs to operate the property: payroll, utilities, taxes, insurance, maintenance, and management fees.',
  'Net Income': 'Profit remaining after ALL expenses including debt service and non-operating items.',
  'Cash Flow': 'Actual cash in or out of the property after every expense. Differs from net income due to non-cash accounting items.',
